## Ideas 

- First open-source AI-powered WWW Search engine by ®esistine
… there are just a handful of real search engines that search their own data

- Free code and private user data
… that’s the goal! We’d like to index billions of pages

- Perfect privacy - we don’t track you, you can check the code
… not even the searched pages can track premium users!

- Usable UX to find something hidden (no need to leave the page)
… optimised for web, news and malware forensics without leaving the search

- Type and refine queries automatically and see the result immediately
… customise and improve the search by topics and even web sites

- Not really a competitor for Google, focus on security and custom search
… your swiss army cyber-knife for the web!
